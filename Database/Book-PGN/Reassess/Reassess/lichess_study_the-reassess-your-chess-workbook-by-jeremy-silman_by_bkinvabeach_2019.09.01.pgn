[SetUp "1"]

{ Black, whose .. f7-f5 was answered by exf5, has to recapture his pawn on f5. What is the best way to do this?

Rxf5 .. this one can be ruled out quick
Bxf5
gxf5

Those are your 3 choices. 1...Bxf5 would be tempting for most players. In fact, how can a move that recaptures a pawn, develops a piece, and threatens the enemy Queen be bad? The problem with 1...Bxf5 is that White gains control over the e4-square after 2. Nde4. 1...gxf5 is Blacks best move. This looks crazy at first, but

a) It keeps the White pieces off of e4
b) Black's central pawns are now mobile
c) It opens the g-file. Who has more space on the kingside? Black. } { [%csl Ge4] }

In passed pawn situations the game often hinges on the square in front of the pawn. The engine suggests Be5, but Silman is suggesting Bg5 so that White can trade off one of the Bishops ... the more the game opens up, the stronger a player is with 2 Bishops. } 13. e5?! { Inaccuracy.

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 Ne4 3. Bh4 c5 4. Qd3 { Black's Knight is attacked and he has to decide how this threat should be dealt with. What is the correct decision here?
My candidate moves:
d5 to protect the Knight (seems better)
Kxf2 to sacrifice the Knight, but create a weakened pawn structure for White
Answer: Before reacting, try to detect the flaws in White's position.
Moving the dark squared Bishop to g5 left the b2 pawn unprotected
The Bishop on h4 is not guarded. All unprotected pieces should be noted!
The d4 pawn in under pressure.
The c1 square doesn't have a defender.
The a1 Rook is unprotected.
Can Black make use of these facts? During an actual game try to spot all positional and tactical possibilities and then try as hard as you can to make something of them. } 4... Qb6 5. b3 Qh6 6.

Yes, and White should refuse it by playing d4. If White does take on c6 by 4. dxc6, Black will reply with 4...Nxc6 and gets tremendous positional compensation for his sacrificed pawn. The d4 square will be owned by Black.
What follows is an example of what can happen. } 4. dxc6 Nxc6 5. Nf3 e5 6. d3 e4 7. Qe2 Bg4 { Black continues to develop.
