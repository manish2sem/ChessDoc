{ [White: Jeremy Silman] [Black: F.R (1539)][Los Angeles, 2004]
This is a pretty clearly advantageous position for white. Silman notes an important detail that white can eventually get his knight to f5 by playing Ng3 but black can never exploit the hole on f4 because his knight can't use g6 or e6. Also, white's bishop on a4 threatens to trade off the key bishop on d7. While this looks quite hopeless, if I were playing black I'd try something super aggressive like a timely f5 pawn sac. It might make a losing position worse but it would atleast leave black with some counterplay. }
1. Rb3 { Very creative move. I wouldn't have seen this (blocking up the a4 bishop looks like an anti pattern but there's no good way to attack it. White threatens to double up on the b file and open it up. } { Creative idea. Definitely feels strange to block the bishops retreat. } 1...

1... g4! 2. Ng1 (2. Nh4 Bxh4 3. gxh4 Qxh4 $19) 2... f3 { The black knight is 'entombed'. It is permanently exiled to the g1 square. Co-incidentally, the white king is also imprisoned by his own knight and pawns. } { This is a relatively rare situation. Much more common is the "entombment" of a bishop on h1 with white king on g1 and a rook on f1. The bishop is on g2 but cannot retreat to f1 so must go to h1. } *

The black position is extremely cramped. Bc4 would allow Nb6 and maybe black to trade pieces with Bg4xf3.
I guess Bd3 is an alternative, but the bishop may prove useful on e2. The plan for white typically is something like Nf3-de-c4
The bishop may be well placed later on f3. There is can guard e4 and control g4 and prevent things like Nh5 for black. } { [%csl Gf3][%cal Gf3d2,Gd2c4,Gb5e2,Ge2f3] } 9.
